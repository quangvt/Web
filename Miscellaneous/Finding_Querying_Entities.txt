Find is different from using a query in two significant ways:

A round-trip to the database will only be made if the entity with the given key is not found in the
 	context.
Find will return entities that are in the Added state. That is, Find will return entities that have 
	been added to the context but have not yet been saved to the database.

------
Note that when you have composite keys you need to use ColumnAttribute or the fluent API to specify 
an ordering for the properties of the composite key. The call to Find must use this order when 
specifying the values that form the key.
